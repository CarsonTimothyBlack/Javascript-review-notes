1. for loop         (Will cycle through loop a set number of times until condition is false)
  --structure--
    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      document.write(i);
    }
    
  --breakdown of parts--
    var i = 0  is the initialization
    i < 10     is the condition
    i++        is the update that happens at the end of each loop runthrough

2. while loop       (Will cycle through the loop while condition is true, usually an unknown amount of times)
  --structure--
    while (i < 10) {
      msg += i + ' x 5 = ' + (i * 5) + '<br />';
      i++;
    }
    
3. do while loop    (Will run at least once, even if while condition is false)
  --structure--
    do {
      msg += i + ' x 5 = ' + (i * 5) + '<br />';
      i++;
    } while (i < 1);
