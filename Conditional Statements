1. Comparison Operators (evaluate a condition to determine true or false)
  ==    equal to      ===   strict equal to
  !=    not equal to  !==   strict not equal to
  >     greater than  >=    greater than or equal to
  <     less than     <=    less than or equal to
  
2.  Condition structures
  --single comparison operator--
    (score >= 50)   (This is the condition. 'score' and '50' are operands, and '>=' is the comparison operator)
    
  --expressions in a comparison operator--
    ((score1 + score2) > (highScore1 + highScore2))     (These expressions evaluate to a single value, so is still like a single comparison)

  --logical operators--
    &&  Logical And     (Both expressions must be true to evaluate to true)
    ||  Logical Or      (At least one expression has to be true to evaluate to true)
    !   Logical Not     (Inverts Boolean evaluation)
    
  --examples of logical operators--
    ((5 > 2) && (6 > 3))  (evaluates to true)
    ((5 > 2) || (6 > 8))  (evaluates to true)
    !(5 > 2)              (evaluates to false)
