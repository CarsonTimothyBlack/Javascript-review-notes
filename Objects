        return this.rooms - this.booked;
      }
    };
    
  --accessing--
    var hotelName = hotel.name; (This variable is given the value of 'Quay', by using this structure to access: object.property/method name.
                                  This '.' is called a member operator)
    var roomsFree = hotel.checkAvailability();  (This variable will run the method in the hotel object)

    var hotelName = hotel['name'];
    var roomsFree = hotel['checkAvailability]();
